# Quantium Virtual Internship

## Project Overview:
* Undertook data cleaning, transformation and preparation of a large sample dataset from a major retailer

* Carried out customer analytics to derive insights into customer spending behaviour and high performing products

* Developed a strategy for the spending manager to implement, which would optimise slaes for specific product categories

* Created a measure to compare different control stores against stores which had recently trialled new layouts

* Used the most suitable control store to benchark performance and used performance analytics to assess the impact of new layouts in trial stores

## Resources:
Python Version: 3.7

Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Project Basis: Virtual Internship with Quantium

## Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

This consisted of the following stages:

* Examined transaction data looking for inconsistencies, missing data and outliers

* Cleaned the data using ordinal mapping and filling of missing values and outliers with statistical best fit values

* Merged customer data with transaction data to create a unified sales dataset

* Defined performance metrics and identified total sales, drivers of sales and highest performing products

* Conducted a deep dive into customer segments to advise which segments should be targeted.

* Some more insights:

    * Highest sales period is during December
    * Top three popular brands is Kettle Chips, Smiths and Doritos
    * Older families with budget purchasing behaviour represent the highest proportion of customers
    * Older families with budget purhcasing behaviour contribute the highest proportion of total sales
    * Older families with mainstream purchasing behaviour buy the most chips on average
    * Young singles/couples with mainstream purchasing behaviour buy the chips with the highest price on average.


## Experimentation and Uplift Testing
I undertook experimentation and uplift testing to identify control stores, consisting of the following stages:

* Determined total sales revenue and total number of customers on monthly and annual bases and number of transactions per customer

* Normalised salaes values and created a metric to compare the sales performance different control stores to each of the trial stores

* Control stores were selected based on their similarity to trial stores

* The performance of trial stores was compared to the control stores to assess the impact of the new trial layout

* Some insights about Control Store vs Store 77

    * sales are lower than control store during the trial period
	 * sales are higher during trial period than rest of year

* Some insights about Control Store vs Store 86

    * sales are lower than control store during the trial period
 	 * sales are higher during trial period than rest of year
