## Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

This consisted of the following stages:

* Examined transaction data looking for inconsistencies, missing data and outliers

* Cleaned the data using ordinal mapping and filling of missing values and outliers with statistical best fit values

* Merged customer data with transaction data to create a unified sales dataset

* Defined performance metrics and identified total sales, drivers of sales and highest performing products
